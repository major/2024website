Elizabeth K. Joseph leads the Open Source Program Office (OSPO) for IBM Z
(mainframes) at IBM. In this role, she works with open source communities
interested in porting their applications to the IBM Z (s390x) hardware
architecture through programs spanning various organizations so developers can
get access to hardware and communities to assist with their efforts.

Her background is primarily Linux systems administration and infrastructure,
having worked for a container startup in San Francisco, spent four years as a
systems engineer on the OpenStack Infrastructure team, and six years on the
Ubuntu Community Council. She is the author of Common OpenStack Deployments
(2016) and The Official Ubuntu Book, 8th (2014) and 9th (2016) editions. At
home in the San Francisco bay area, she sits on the Board of Directors for
Partimus.org, a non-profit in the Bay Area providing Linux-based computers to
schools and community centers in need.
