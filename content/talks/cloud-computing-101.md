If you've always been curious about the cloud, or have had questions about how
to start building in the cloud, this talk is for you! You'll learn what the
different resources and services are available in the cloud, when to use them,
and how to deploy them in the cloud. You'll also learn how to solve common
challenges via cloud compute. You'll get an overview of Infrastructure as a
Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service and how each service
can be used when you build on the cloud as well as tips on how to best set up
your cloud security. We'll also do an infrastructure as code demo with Linode
and Terraform.
